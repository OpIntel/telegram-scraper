# TGS: Telegram Scraper, Forwarder & Viewer

A Python tool for scraping Telegram channels into local SQLite databases, with built-in real-time message forwarding between channels and a self-contained offline HTML viewer for browsing the results.

## Features

**Scraping**
- Scrape any channel you're a member of into a per-channel SQLite database (`<channel_id>/<channel_id>.db`)
- Captures message text, sender info, dates, replies, views, forwards, reactions, and post authors
- Optional media download (photos, videos, documents) with a toggle
- Continuous (live) scraping mode that keeps the DB up to date as new messages arrive
- Concurrent media downloads with configurable batch size and automatic FloodWait handling
- Rescrape and "fix missing media" tools to repair partial downloads

**Forwarding**
- Real-time forwarding rules from a source channel to a destination channel
- Filter by content type (text, images, videos, documents)
- Two modes: **copy** (sends as a new message, no "Forwarded from" header) or **forward** (preserves the header)
- Toggle rules on/off, edit, or delete without restarting
- **Backfill** historical messages over a chosen date range with adjustable delay
- **Combined mode** runs scraping and forwarding together in a single session

**Search**
- Query scraped databases by keyword/regex, date range, sender/username, or media type
- Advanced search combines multiple filters
- Search across one channel, several, or all of them at once

**Auth & networking**
- Sign in via QR code (displayed as ASCII art in the terminal) or phone number
- Two-factor authentication supported
- Optional SOCKS5, SOCKS4, or HTTP proxy with auth, plus a built-in proxy connectivity test

**Export**
- One-shot export of every tracked channel to CSV and JSON, written next to the database

**Offline viewer (`telegram-viewer.html`)**
- Single-file HTML app you can open directly in a browser, no server or install required
- Loads `.db` files via sql.js (compiled SQLite running in the browser)
- Drop in the channel folder to attach scraped media (photos and videos render inline)
- Load multiple chats at once and switch between them
- Per-chat search and a global search across all loaded chats
- Strict CSP, so it runs entirely offline with no network requests after load

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- A Telegram account
- Telegram API credentials (`api_id` and `api_hash`), available at https://my.telegram.org

### Python dependencies

```bash
pip install telethon qrcode
```

Optional, only needed if you want to route through a proxy:

```bash
pip install pysocks "python-socks[asyncio]"
```

## Setup

1. Install dependencies (above).
2. Run the scraper:
   ```bash
   python telegram_scraper_with_forwarding.py
   ```
3. On first launch it will ask for your `api_id` and `api_hash`, then walk you through QR or phone login. Credentials and session state are saved to `state.json` in the working directory.

## Main menu

```
[S] Scrape channels                [W] Forwarding rules
[C] Continuous scraping            [D] Search database
[B] Combined scrape + forward      [P] Proxy settings
[M] Media scraping: ON/OFF         [Q] Quit
[L] List & add channels
[R] Remove channels
[E] Export data (CSV + JSON)
[T] Rescrape media
[F] Fix missing media
```

Typical first-run flow: `L` to list and add channels you're in, then `S` to scrape, or `C` for live, or `B` if you also have forwarding rules configured.

## Forwarding rules

Open with `[W]` from the main menu.

- `[A]` Add: pick source, pick destination (a tracked channel, a `@username`, or a raw `-100...` ID), pick content types, pick copy vs forward.
- `[E]` Edit, `[T]` toggle, `[D]` delete an existing rule.
- `[S]` Start forwarding: listens for new messages and forwards them according to enabled rules.
- `[H]` Backfill: replay messages from a date range through a rule (useful when you set up a rule after the fact). The source channel must already be scraped locally.

## File layout

After running, your working directory will look something like:

```
.
├── telegram_scraper_with_forwarding.py
├── telegram-viewer.html
├── state.json                       # config, session state, rules
├── -1001234567890/                  # one folder per channel
│   ├── -1001234567890.db            # SQLite messages DB
│   ├── -1001234567890_<name>.csv    # created by [E] export
│   ├── -1001234567890_<name>.json   # created by [E] export
│   └── media/
│       ├── photos/
│       ├── videos/
│       └── documents/
└── channels_list.csv                # optional, from [L]
```

## Using the offline viewer

1. Open `telegram-viewer.html` in any modern browser, or serve it over `localhost` (see below).
2. Click **Choose Files** and select one or more `.db` files (and optionally exported `.json` files).
3. To make media render inline, also point the media picker at the channel folder so the viewer can resolve the relative paths stored in the DB.
4. Use the per-chat search box to filter messages within a chat, or the top search to search across every chat you've loaded.

The viewer is fully client-side. Nothing is uploaded anywhere; your DB never leaves the browser tab.

### Serving over localhost (recommended)

Some browsers restrict what a page opened via `file://` can load. sql.js's WebAssembly, the directory picker, and media blobs all behave better when the viewer is served over HTTP. Run a tiny local server in the folder that contains `telegram-viewer.html` and your channel folders, then visit `http://localhost:8000/telegram-viewer.html`.

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
cd /path/to/your/scraper-folder
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

**Windows (PowerShell or CMD)**

```powershell
cd C:\path\to\your\scraper-folder
python -m http.server 8000
```

Stop the server with `Ctrl+C`. The server only listens on your own machine; nothing is exposed to the network. If port 8000 is taken, pick another (for example, `8080`).

If you don't have Python on the path, any other static server works too: `npx serve`, `php -S localhost:8000`, VS Code's "Live Server" extension, and so on.

## Database schema

Each `<channel>/<channel>.db` contains a single `messages` table:

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `message_id` | INTEGER UNIQUE | Telegram message ID |
| `date` | TEXT | ISO timestamp |
| `sender_id` | INTEGER | |
| `first_name`, `last_name`, `username` | TEXT | |
| `message` | TEXT | message body |
| `media_type` | TEXT | `photo`, `video`, `document`, etc. |
| `media_path` | TEXT | relative path to the downloaded file |
| `reply_to` | INTEGER | replied-to message id |
| `post_author` | TEXT | for channels with signed posts |
| `views`, `forwards` | INTEGER | |
| `reactions` | TEXT | serialized reaction summary |

The DB uses WAL mode and indexes on `message_id` and `date`. The script auto-migrates older DBs that are missing newer columns.

## Notes & limits

- You can only scrape and forward channels your account is a member of, since Telegram enforces this server-side.
- Telegram applies aggressive rate limits. The scraper handles `FloodWaitError` automatically by sleeping the requested duration, but very large backfills will still take time.
- `state.json` contains your `api_id`, `api_hash`, and references to your session, so treat it like a credential file.
- Be mindful of Telegram's Terms of Service and the rules of any channel you scrape or repost from.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Proxy dependencies not installed"**: run `pip install pysocks "python-socks[asyncio]"` and restart.
- **Login keeps failing**: delete the `.session` file in the working directory and log in again.
- **Media is missing in the viewer**: make sure you also picked the channel folder (or its parent) in the media picker so relative paths resolve.
- **Some messages show no media even after scraping**: use `[F] Fix missing media` from the main menu to retry just the missing files.
